    <h2>Bio</h2>  
     <p>
        Influenced by the earlier works of Fred Hammond, Marvin Sapp, Kirk Franklin, and many more, Curtis has developed 
        a smooth &amp; unique sound that compliments his persona. He has sang in multiple mass choirs in the Tri-State area 
        and became a lead vocalist for the NE Baptist Convention Youth Choir and the Northern Delaware Chapter of the 
        Gospel Music Workshop of America. He has brought his gift of singing into the field of the arts by becoming a soloist in 
        several theater productions in the Tri-State area.
        <br>
        Curtis' smooth brand of worship and praise has been enjoyed by many. He isn't afraid to blend components from all 
        gospel types to create a new sound. He has been known for his vocal range, velvety melodies, and his calm, yet powerful 
        approach to worship.
